# Web server

some specifics about this infrastructure: 1.What is a server A server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network.

2.What is the role of the domain name A domain name is a unique string of text that's used to identify a specific resource on the internet. This could be anything from a website to an email or FTP server. When you access a website, its domain name is converted to a set of numbers (an IP address) to communicate with the website server to send requests for and receive website content.
